# Memory Card Game

The Memory Card Game is a classic concentration challenge where players test their memory by matching pairs of cards. Each card features a unique image on its face, while all cards share the same design on their back. The game board includes a special center card that remains face-up throughout the game, serving as an anchor point.

Players take turns flipping cards by clicking on them, trying to find matching pairs. When a player reveals two cards that match, those cards remain face-up. If the revealed cards don't match, they automatically flip face-down after a brief moment, and the player must remember their positions for future attempts.

The game tracks the player's performance through moves taken and time elapsed, adding a competitive element for those who wish to improve their scores. Success requires concentration, spatial memory, and strategic thinking as players work to complete all matches in the fewest possible moves and shortest time.
